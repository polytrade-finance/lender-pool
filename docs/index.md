## Lender Pool - Documentation

LenderPool is an endless pool allowing Lenders to supply capital.  
The Pool then automatically allocates that capital across a 3rd party Defi protocol to hold stable and earn extra yield.
When Lenders supply to the Pool, they receive an equivalent amount of T-stable coin, which they can stake to get interest on their investments. Additionally lenders will receive trade token reward.

### Interest Calculation

Interest is received in T-Stable tokens. Interest is calculated using the formula given below

interest = (amount deposited _ APY _ time duration)/100

### Trade Reward

Lenders will receive an additional reward per block. Trade tokens will be distributed to users.

### Redeem Pool

Lenders can exchange T-stable received for stable token from redeem pool. Stable token will be added to Redeem Pool by the Polytrade team.
