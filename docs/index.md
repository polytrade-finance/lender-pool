## Lender Pool - Documentation

LenderPool is an endless pool allowing Lenders to supply capital.  
The Pool then automatically allocates that capital across a 3rd party Defi protocol to hold stable and earn extra yield.
When Lenders supply to the Pool, they receive an equivalent amount of T-stable coin, which they can stake to get interest on their investments.
